Silverback is an entity component framework for building games and interactive apps. It can be used in client and server environment. By the used architecture you can develop complex (possibly emergent) behavior based on simple properties. It is based upon the two basic ideas of:
Separating logic and data and isolating data in meaningfully identifiable units. It uses [PIXI.js](https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js/) for WebGL and Canvas rendering, and supports desktop and mobile web browsers.

The project was recently revived and is still in an early stage, but you can build production ready games for the browser.


## Installation:
