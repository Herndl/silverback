# Silverback Game Engine

Silverback is an entity component framework, which is heavily based on the [Ash framework](http://www.ashframework.org/) and rewritten for the purpose of performance and multi-player games. The basic ideas and concepts is very similar however the conversion to Typescript brings all the benefits of this language with it. Silverback can be used on the server with NodeJS or only on the client.
